* Pre-IB computer science project
** Short overview
   - The project allows you to increase your final grade by a maximum
     of 3 grades.
   - The program you write must process text data in a meaningful way,
     but the end result does not have to be a real-life application.
   - Grading is based on
     - program specification
     - program correctness
     - readability of code.
   - Your submission consists of
     - one document with problem specification and description of test
       cases
     - one ~.java~-file containing the code
     - possibly one or more text data files.
** Grading levels
*** Criteria for level one
**** Specification
     There is a sensible specification of what the program does.
**** Correctness
     The program works correctly in three documented test cases.
     - First is a basic case with typical data.
     - Two other are special cases that the program is able to handle
       correctly (for example, empty data file, or incorrect input).
**** Readability
     - Program code is correctly indented.
     - Correct amount of whitespace to enhance readability.
*** Additional criteria for level two
**** Readability
     - Constants are identified and named appropriately.
     - Code is well-organized, using functions and/or classes whenever
       necessary.
     - Names of constants, variables and functions are appropriate
       (make sense).
     - The most complex part of the code is explained with a comment.
*** Additional criteria for level three
**** Correctness
     The correct working of the program has been documented in all
     possible cases except for the computer running out of memory.
**** Readability
     - All non-trivial parts of the code are commented.
     - The role and functioning of all functions and/or classes are
       explained in comments.
