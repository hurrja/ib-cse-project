* Pre-IB computer science project
** Short overview
   - The project allows you to increase your final grade by a maximum
     of 3 grades.
   - The program you write must process text data in a meaningful way,
     but the end result does not have to be a real-life application.
   - Grading is based on
     - problem specification
     - program correctness
     - readability of code.
   - Your submission consists of
     - one document with problem specification and description of test
       cases
     - one ~.java~-file containing the code
     - possibly one or more data files.
** Grading levels
*** One
**** Specification
     There is a sensible specification of what the program does.
**** Correctness
     The program works correctly in three documented test cases.
     - First is a basic case
